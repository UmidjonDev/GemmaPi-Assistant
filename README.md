# GemmaPi-Assistant
GemmaPi-Assistant is a lightweight, voice-driven AI system designed to run efficiently on the Raspberry Pi 5. It combines OpenAI’s Whisper model for speech-to-text transcription with Google’s Gemma 3 large language model to enable natural, real-time conversations directly on edge hardware. The assistant listens, understands, and responds intelligently without the need for powerful cloud servers, making it ideal for personal AI applications, robotics integration, and voice-controlled environments.

Key Features:

* Real-time speech recognition using Whisper

* Natural-language reasoning and response via Gemma 3

* Deployable on Raspberry Pi 5 or other low-power devices

* Supports multiple languages

* Modular design for integration with robotics or IoT systems

Technologies Used:
Python, Whisper, Gemma 3, Torch, Transformers, Raspberry Pi OS
